My political Stance:
I think Imran khan has become cult and a disgrace to pakistani politics . He was given 3 and half years and he did not succeed in his promises. His party is ruling in KPK for almost 13 years and look at kpk now . He is a fitnah that needs to be tackled harshly.

My next stance is that I think Nawaz party is best for pakistan . Coming from a balochistan's background i know this punjab government is doing great in terms of helping economy grow and up the lifestyle of common people.
